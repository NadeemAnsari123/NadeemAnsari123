I am an AWS & DevOps professional actively involved in real-world cloud projects, with a strong focus on designing, automating, and managing scalable AWS infrastructure while following industry-standard DevOps and security best practices.

I have strong hands-on experience with AWS core services, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and cloud automation, along with practical exposure to containerization technologies. I have also worked on integrating and managing Amazon RDS databases with cloud-based applications, ensuring performance, availability, and security.

I continuously work on enhancing my skills in CI/CD pipelines, cloud security, monitoring, and scalable system architectures.
